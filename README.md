This R package is an interface to the [MonkeyLearn API](http://docs.monkeylearn.com/article/api-reference/). MonkeyLearn is a Machine Learning platform on the cloud that allows software companies and developers to easily extract actionable data from text. :monkey:

The current goal of the package is not to support machine learning algorithms development with R or the API, but only to *reap the benefits of the existing modules on Monkeylearn*. Therefore, there are only two types of functions, one for using *extractors* (`monkey_extract` and the old less user-friendly `monkeylearn_extract`), and one for using *classifiers* (`monkey_classify` and the old less user-friendly `monkeylearn_classify`). The difference between extractors and classifiers is that extractors output information about words, whereas classifiers output information about each text as a whole. Named entity recognition is an extraction task, whereas assigning a topic to a text is a classification task.

# Installation and setup

To install the stable CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("monkeylearn")
```

To install the development version:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/monkeylearn")
```

To get an API key for MonkeyLearn, register at <http://monkeylearn.com/>. Note that MonkeyLearn supports registration through GitHub, which makes the registration process really easy. For ease of use, save your API key as an environment variable as described at <http://stat545.com/bit003_api-key-env-var.html>.

All functions of the package will conveniently look for your API key using `Sys.getenv("MONKEYLEARN_KEY")` so if your API key is an environment variable called "MONKEYLEARN\_KEY" you don't need to input it manually.

Please also create a "MONKEYLEARN\_PLAN" environment variable indicating whether your [Monkeylearn plan](https://app.monkeylearn.com/main/my-account/tab/change-plan/) is "free", "team" or "business".
